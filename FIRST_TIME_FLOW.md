# FIRST-TIME FLOW — GameForge Mobile

## The 30-Second Rule

A first-time user MUST experience value within 30 seconds.

```
0-3 seconds:   See ONE dominant action
3-10 seconds:  Tap that action
10-30 seconds: Experience visible progress or delight
```

If any step fails, the UI has failed.

## The Hierarchy

### Above the Fold (Visible Without Scrolling)

1. **Hero Card:** 60% of screen height
   - Large, unmissable CTA: "Create a Gift"
   - Compelling subtitle: "For someone you love"
   - Trust signal: "Takes 60 seconds"
   - Seasonal visual treatment (Auto-adapts: Eternal Romance in Feb, Winter Majlis in Dec-Jan, etc.)

2. **Companion:** Dodo in corner, waving, contextual greeting

### Below the Fold (Scroll to See)

3. **Quick Actions:** Gift Game, My Projects, Templates
4. **Feature Cards:** For returning users
5. **Stats/Social Proof:** Only after value is clear

---

## The Click-Through

### Step 1: Hero Tap
User taps "Create a Gift" → Full-screen wizard opens

### Step 2: Wizard (5 questions, 60 seconds max)

```
Q1: "Who is this for?"
    [Name input] — Large, friendly, one field

Q2: "What's the occasion?"
    [Birthday] [Anniversary] [Just Because] [Other]
    — Tappable pills, not dropdowns

Q3: "Pick the vibe"
    [Fun & Playful] [Heartfelt] [Nostalgic]
    — Visual cards with previews

Q4: "Your message"
    [Text area] — Pre-filled example, easy to modify

Q5: "Choose game style"
    [Memory] [Puzzle] [Quiz] [Adventure] [Surprise Me]
    — Visual previews of each
```

### Step 3: Generation
- Premium loading animation (5-8 seconds)
- Dodo "working magic" animation
- Progress indicators with encouraging messages

### Step 4: Result
- Full preview of the game
- Giant "Share" button
- Platform options: WhatsApp, Instagram, Copy Link
- "Try it yourself" preview button

## Copy Guidelines for First-Time

### Hero Copy Options

**Romantic (Eternal Romance — Feb 1-14):**
> "Create a gift they'll treasure forever"
> "For the one who means everything"

**Warm (Winter Majlis — Dec 4-Jan 31):**
> "Create a gift they'll actually remember"
> "Takes 60 seconds. Lasts forever."

**Spiritual (Nocturnal Revival — Ramadan):**
> "Share something meaningful this Ramadan"
> "A gift from the heart, playable anytime"

**Celebratory (Eid — Golden Reunion):**
> "Make Eid unforgettable"
> "A gift they can play, not just open"

**Energetic (Neon Dubai Summer — May-Aug):**
> "Turn any moment into a game"
> "Create something worth sharing"

### Button Copy

- ✅ "Start Creating"
- ✅ "Let's Go"
- ✅ "Create Gift"
- ❌ "Get Started" (generic)
- ❌ "Begin" (cold)
- ❌ "Try Now" (weak)

### Trust Signals

- "Takes 60 seconds"
- "No sign-up required"
- "Free to create"
- "Shareable instantly"

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. The Feature Dump
❌ Showing all features on home screen
✅ One dominant action, others below fold

### 2. The Welcome Modal
❌ "Welcome to GameForge! Let us show you around..."
✅ The UI itself is the tutorial

### 3. The Choice Paralysis
❌ "What would you like to do today?"
✅ "Create a gift for someone you love" (TELL them)

### 4. The Empty State
❌ "No projects yet. Create your first project!"
✅ Hero card IS the first action — no empty state visible

### 5. The Sign-Up Wall
❌ Requiring account before value
✅ Create first, sign up to save

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Hero tap rate (first session) | ≥60% | — |
| Wizard completion rate | ≥75% | — |
| Time to first share | ≤90 sec | — |
| First-session share rate | ≥40% | — |

### Failure Indicators

- Hero tap rate <40% → Redesign hero
- Wizard abandonment >30% → Simplify wizard
- Time to first share >3 min → Remove friction
- Zero shares first session → Fix share UX

## Testing Checklist

Before any release, verify:

- [ ] Hero card is visible without scrolling on iPhone SE
- [ ] Hero CTA is tappable within 3 seconds of app open
- [ ] Wizard completes in under 90 seconds
- [ ] Share button works on all platforms
- [ ] Loading states have premium animation
- [ ] Seasonal theme is correctly applied
- [ ] Dodo companion enhances, doesn't distract

*First impressions are non-negotiable.*
*If the first 30 seconds don't work, nothing else matters.*
