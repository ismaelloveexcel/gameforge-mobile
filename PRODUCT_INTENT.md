# PRODUCT INTENT — GameForge Mobile

> **Note on Naming:** "GameForge Mobile" is the technical product name. The product is positioned as an **emotional gifting platform** that uses games as the medium — NOT a game builder tool. Marketing and UX should emphasize the gifting experience over the game creation mechanics.

## The One-Line Promise
**Create a shareable mini-game for someone you love — in 60 seconds.**

---

## Why This Exists

People want to give memorable, personal gifts.
Physical gifts are forgettable. Generic e-cards are soulless.
A playable game with their name, your message, their favorite things? **That gets shared.**

GameForge exists so non-technical people can create something that feels magical and personal — without learning anything.

---

## The Core Experience

### First-Time User (Cold Start)
1. Opens app → sees ONE thing they can do: "Create a Gift Game"
2. Taps → guided 5-question wizard (no overwhelm)
3. 60 seconds later → shareable link to a personalized mini-game
4. They send it → recipient plays it → both feel something

That's it. Everything else is secondary.

## What GameForge Is NOT

- ❌ A game engine for developers
- ❌ A no-code platform requiring learning
- ❌ A template picker that requires decisions
- ❌ An AI chat interface
- ❌ A generic SaaS dashboard

## Design Principles

### 1. One Action Per Screen
Every screen has ONE dominant action. Everything else is secondary.

### 2. Progress > Perfection
Show something working before asking for refinement.

### 3. Emotional > Functional
A gift game wizard should feel like wrapping a present, not filling a form.

### 4. Shareability is a Feature
Every output should be designed to be shared on social media.

### 5. UAE-Current
The app should feel like it was designed for someone in Dubai/Abu Dhabi right now — current, seasonal, aspirational.

- Emojis sparingly, contextually

---

## The Non-Negotiables

1. A first-time user MUST be able to create AND share a game in under 2 minutes
2. The primary CTA MUST be visible without scrolling
3. Zero tutorials — the UI must be self-explanatory
4. Every game MUST have a beautiful share preview image
5. The app MUST feel current to the UAE context
